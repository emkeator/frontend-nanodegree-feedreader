# Project Overview

In this project, I built a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## How to Run this Project

1. Download or clone the files to your computer.
2. Run the Index.html file to view the application & the spec runner.
3. To view the test suites, open jasmine --> spec --> feedreader.js.
